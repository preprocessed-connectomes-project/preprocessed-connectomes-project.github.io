abstract = {An important problem in contemporary statistics is to understand the relationship among a large number of variables based on a dataset, usually with p, the number of the variables, much larger than n, the sample size. Recent efforts have focused on modeling static covariance matrices where pairwise covariances are considered invariant. In many real systems, however, these pairwise relations often change. To characterize the changing correlations in a high dimensional system, we study a class of dynamic covariance models (DCMs) assumed to be sparse, and investigate for the first time a unified theory for understanding their non-asymptotic error rates and model selection properties. In particular, in the challenging high dimension regime, we highlight a new uniform consistency theory in which the sample size can be seen as n4/5 when the bandwidth parameter is chosen as h∝n−1/5 for accounting for the dynamics. We show that this result holds uniformly over a range of the variable used for modeling the dynamic...},

abstract = {We sought to determine whether functional connectivity streams that link sensory, attentional, and higher-order cognitive circuits are atypical in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We applied a graph-theory method to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 120 children with ADHD and 120 age-matched typically developing children (TDC). Starting in unimodal primary cortex-visual, auditory, and somatosensory-we used stepwise functional connectivity to calculate functional connectivity paths at discrete numbers of relay stations (or link-step distances). First, we characterized the functional connectivity streams that link sensory, attentional, and higher-order cognitive circuits in TDC and found that systems do not reach the level of integration achieved by adults. Second, we searched for stepwise functional connectivity differences between children with ADHD and TDC. We found that, at the initial steps of sensory functional connectivity streams, patients display significant enhancements of connectivity degree within neighboring areas of primary cortex, while connectivity to attention-regulatory areas is reduced. Third, at subsequent link-step distances from primary sensory cortex, children with ADHD show decreased connectivity to executive processing areas and increased degree of connections to default mode regions. Fourth, in examining medication histories in children with ADHD, we found that children medicated with psychostimulants present functional connectivity streams with higher degree of connectivity to regions subserving attentional and executive processes compared to medication-na\"{\i}ve children. We conclude that predominance of local sensory processing and lesser influx of information to attentional and executive regions may reduce the ability to organize and control the balance between external and internal sources of information in ADHD.},

@article{Kyeong2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is currently diagnosed by a diagnostic interview, mainly based on subjective reports from parents or teachers. It is necessary to develop methods that rely on objectively measureable neurobiological data to assess brain-behavior relationship in patients with ADHD. We investigated the application of a topological data analysis tool, Mapper, to analyze the brain functional connectivity data from ADHD patients.

METHODS: To quantify the disease severity using the neuroimaging data, the decomposition of individual functional networks into normal and disease components by the healthy state model (HSM) was performed, and the magnitude of the disease component (MDC) was computed. Topological data analysis using Mapper was performed to distinguish children with ADHD (n = 196) from typically developing controls (TDC) (n = 214).

RESULTS: In the topological data analysis, the partial clustering results of patients with ADHD and normal subjects were shown in a chain-like graph. In the correlation analysis, the MDC showed a significant increase with lower intelligence scores in TDC. We also found that the rates of comorbidity in ADHD significantly increased when the deviation of the functional connectivity from HSM was large. In addition, a significant correlation between ADHD symptom severity and MDC was found in part of the dataset.

CONCLUSIONS: The application of HSM and topological data analysis methods in assessing the brain functional connectivity seem to be promising tools to quantify ADHD symptom severity and to reveal the hidden relationship between clinical phenotypic variables and brain connectivity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating multiple graphical models simultaneously using the fused lasso penalty, which encourages adjacent graphs to share similar structures. A motivating example is the analysis of brain networks of Alzheimer's disease using neuroimaging data. Specifically, we may wish to estimate a brain network for the normal controls (NC), a brain network for the patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a brain network for Alzheimer's patients (AD). We expect the two brain networks for NC and MCI to share common structures but not to be identical to each other; similarly for the two brain networks for MCI and AD. The proposed formulation can be solved using a second-order method. Our key technical contribution is to establish the necessary and sufficient condition for the graphs to be decomposable. Based on this key property, a simple screening rule is presented, which decomposes the large graphs into small subgraphs and allows an efficient estimation of multiple ...},

abstract = {Resting state fMRI is a powerful method of functional brain imaging, which can reveal information of functional connectivity between regions during rest. In this paper, we present a novel method, called Functional-Anatomical Discriminative Regions (FADR), for selecting a discriminative subset of functional-anatomical regions of the brain in order to characterize functional connectivity abnormalities in mental disorders. FADR integrates Independent Component Analysis with a sparse feature selection strategy, namely Elastic Net, in a supervised framework to extract a new sparse representation. In particular, ICA is used for obtaining group Resting State Networks and functional information is extracted from the subject-specific spatial maps. Anatomical information is incorporated to localize the discriminative regions. Thus, functional-anatomical information is combined in the new descriptor, which characterizes areas of different networks and carries discriminative power. Experimental results on the public database ADHD-200 validate the method being able to automatically extract discriminative areas and extending results from previous studies. The classification ability is evaluated showing that our method performs better than the average of the teams in the ADHD-200 Global Competition while giving relevant information about the disease by selecting the most discriminative regions at the same time.},

The data shared on the site span a broad spectrum of functional and structural brain connectivity information from humans across the entire age range (fetal to age 89), representing an array of different neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease populations (autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and APOE-4 carriers). An analysis combining 7 different datasets shared on the site illustrates the diversity of the data and the potential for yielding deeper insight by assessing new connectivity matrices with respect to population-wide network properties represented in the UMCD.

We further extend our partial quantile covariance techniques to functional composite quantile regression (CQR) defining partial composite quantile covariance. There are three major contributions. (1) We define partial quantile covariance between two scalar variables through linear quantile regression. We compute \{PQR\} basis by sequentially maximizing the partial quantile covariance between the response and projections of functional covariates. (2) In order to efficiently extract \{PQR\} basis, we develop a \{SIMPQR\} algorithm analog to simple partial least squares (SIMPLS). (3) Under the homoscedasticity assumption, we extend our techniques to partial composite quantile covariance and use it to find the partial composite quantile regression (PCQR) basis. The \{SIMPQR\} algorithm is then modified to obtain the \{SIMPCQR\} algorithm. Two simulation studies show the superiority of our proposed methods. Two real data from ADHD-200 sample and \{ADNI\} are analyzed using our proposed methods. "
